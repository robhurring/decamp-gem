# Decamp

This is a small scraper for the decamp.com bus schedules. It is a hack right now since their HTML is a bit of a mess and I'm trying to play around and see how consistent I can get some of it.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'decamp'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install decamp
